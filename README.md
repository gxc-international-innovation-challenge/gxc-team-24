## Skiing is not simply a winter sport, but a community in Germany
Every year, hundreds of people in Germany look forward to the snowy season when they can enjoy different winter sports and outdoor events, typically including skiing. Considered as a healthy exercise for all ages, skiing is not only a hobby but a must-try sport in the winter. The popularity of skiing in Germany can be seen through different competitions and educational programs which gather a large number of ski athletes, trainers and fans. With respect to this winter sport, the German Ski Federation has a long-established reputation as a national organization committed to the development of skiing. What they have concerned for many years is how to strengthen the current ski community in Germany as many residents are still acting individually or within their network in the ski events or trips. In the Virtual International Challenge 2020, the Team is happy to put forward our innovative ideas to the German Ski Federation as the solution.

## No longer let yourself enjoy skiing alone!
Being excited about the next winter season, you are planning to have a trip to one of the famous ski resorts in Germany, but no one is interested to join. In the worse scenario, you will go skiing alone or stay at home over the holiday. Is it sad? Yes, but hold up! Our G-Ski Mobile App will help you find a company for an unforgettable skiing vacation. 

Developed from a social network based idea, G-Ski is an open platform that allows you to connect with others who have a great passion for skiing through different means of communication. You will build your own personal image as a ski enthusiast no matter a professional, a learner or a big fan. The network can be personally tailored to your main ski form, level, and ski resort. With a wonderful display of German ski resorts, G-Ski App can help you choose the best destination for your winter vacation. As another highlight, other users can answer any of your question in the Forum so you don't get stuck in any doubt that hinders your enjoyment in skiing.
