## Skiing is not simply a winter sport, but a community in Germany
Every year, hundreds of people in Germany look forward to the snowy season when they can enjoy different winter sports and outdoor events, typically including skiing. Considered as a healthy exercise for all ages, skiing is not only a hobby but a must-try sport in the winter. The popularity of skiing in Germany can be seen through different competitions and educational programs which gather a large number of ski athletes, trainers and fans. With respect to this winter sport, the German Ski Federation has a long-established reputation as a national organization committed to the development of skiing. What they have concerned for many years is how to strengthen the current ski community in Germany as many residents are still acting individually or within their network in the ski events or trips. In the Virtual International Challenge 2020, the Team is happy to put forward our innovative ideas to the German Ski Federation as the solution.

## The problem
An intensive research was conducted by the Team to discover the underlying problem. In addition to our own [Research](https://github.com/gxc-international-innovation-challenge/gxc-team-24/wiki/Research), data was gathered and analyzed from the [Interview](https://github.com/gxc-international-innovation-challenge/gxc-team-24/wiki/Interview-with-Challenge-giver) with the German Ski Federation stakeholders. The fact brought to the light was that people shown up at ski resorts and in events often find it difficult to bond with the winter sport community. Therefore, they mostly act with their own knowledge and group throughout the whole experience as they feel more comfortable to be with friends and family members in such events or ski trips. In addition, people usually get confused by different sources of information. German ski resorts have their own digital platform which is merely designed for serviced-related purposes such as selling tickets. People just follow the own service path and totally lack of community sense. 

As a result of individual acting from winter sport enthusiasts, more efforts and channels must be made to ensure that information is distributed to the right customers. In some cases, people do not want to go skiing alone and will cancel the plan if they fail to find a company. The problematic situation has hampered the German Ski Federation from building a strong community of winter sport enthusiasts.. As a national organization, the German Ski Federation also wants to encourage people to talk and feel engaged after the ski trips and events. In this way, skiing will be a healthy hobby that connects people in common together.
