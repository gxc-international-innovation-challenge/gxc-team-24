# Welcome to G-Ski!
Introducing a new way to stay find winter sport buddies, build communities and explore new ski resorts.

## Skiing is not simply a winter sport, but a community in Germany
Every year, hundreds of people in Germany look forward to the snowy season when they can enjoy different winter sports and outdoor events, typically including skiing. Considered as a healthy exercise for all ages, skiing is not only a hobby but a must-try sport in the winter. The popularity of skiing in Germany can be seen through different competitions and educational programs which gather a large number of ski athletes, trainers and fans. With respect to this winter sport, the German Ski Federation has a long-established reputation as a national organization committed to the development of skiing. What they have concerned for many years is how to strengthen the current ski community in Germany as many residents are still acting individually or within their network in the ski events or trips. In the Virtual International Challenge 2020, the Team is happy to put forward our innovative ideas to the German Ski Federation as the solution. 

## The problem
People are often intimidated by the idea of doing wintersports alone as the trip can be lonely. Therefore, they mostly act with their own knowledge and group throughout the whole experience as they feel more comfortable to be with friends and family members in e.g. ski trips. The problem is to enable all German winter sport enthusiasts to find new friends to talk to and do sports with.

## The solution
Analyzing the root problem, the Team proposed that our mobile app called **G-Ski** solves the problem. Developed from a social network based idea, G-Ski is an open platform that allows you to connect with others who have a great passion for winter sports through different means of communication. You will build your own personal image as a ski enthusiast – a professional, a learner or a big fan. The network can be personally tailored to your main ski form, skill level, and ski resort. With a wonderful display of German ski resorts, G-Ski App can help you choose the best destination for your winter vacation. As another highlight, other users can answer any of your question in the Forum so you don't get stuck in any doubt that hinders your enjoyment in skiing.

### How G-Ski enriches your life
Being excited about the next winter season, you are planning to have a trip to one of the famous ski resorts in Germany, but no one is interested to join.
